In a mixing bowl combine 1 tablespoon of olive oil with honey, lime, cumin, coriander, cayenne pepper and a pinch of salt. Add in chicken breast and mix to coat well on all sides. Heat a grill pan or an outside grill over medium-high heat and cook the chicken until cooked through and no longer pink in the inside, 10-12 minutes. Set aside on a chopping board and allow it to rest for 5 minutes, then slice it. In a large bowl mix quinoa, sweet corn, tomatoes, onions, and fresh chopped cilantro. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil, lime juice and season with salt and pepper to taste, then mix to combine. Divide quinoa mixture among 4 bowls, then top with sliced grilled chicken and avocado. Enjoy!
